# Restaurant Menu

- Menu Adding
    - Add the menu item in a file
- Menu Displaying
    - Each items on the menu should have similar width
- Menu Deleting
- Menu Editing

## Bugs
- When Editing a menu item, a new line is added out of nowhere

## Features want to add
- Check whether the menu is present on the file or not (haven't learn file handling yet)
- Use data from text file rather than importing and calling by reference (haven't learn file handling yet)
